# COGS <-> Buzzshot

WORK IN PROGRESS NOT READY FOR USE JUST YET (BUT GET IN TOUCH IN YOU WANT TO TRY IT!)

This plugin allows you to automatically transfer data between Buzzshot and COGS.
It will give you a window when you start your COGS show in which you can select
a Buzzshot game.

Until a game is selected the plugin will not be able to sync data. We recommend
adding a checklist item to your COGS pre-show with a condition that "Game
Selected" is ON.
